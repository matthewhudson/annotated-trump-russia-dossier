      <h3>
        US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP'S ACTIVITIES
        IN RUSSIA AND COMPROMISING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE KREMLIN
      </h3>
      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting at least
          5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and
          divisions in western alliance
        </li>
        <li>
          So far TRUMP has declined various sweetener real estate business deals
          offered him in Russia in order to further the Kremlin's cultivation of
          him. However he and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of
          intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other
          political rivals
        </li>
        <li>
          Former top Russian intelligence officer claims FSB has compromised
          TRUMP through his activities in Moscow sufficiently to be able to
          blackmail him. According to several knowledgeable sources, his conduct
          in Moscow has included perverted sexual acts which have been arranged/
          monitored by the FSB
        </li>
        <li>
          A dossier of compromising material on Hillary CLINTON has been
          collated by the Russian Intelligence Services over many years and
          mainly comprises bugged conversations she had on various visits to
          Russia and intercepted phone calls rather than any embarrassing
          conduct. The dossier is controlled by Kremlin spokesman, PESKOV,
          directly on PUTIN's orders. However it has not as yet been distributed
          abroad, including to TRUMP. Russian intentions for its deployment
          still unclear
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Detail</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Speaking to a trusted compatriot in June 2016 sources A and B, a
          senior Russian Foreign Ministry figure and a former top level Russian
          intelligence officer still active inside the Kremlin respectively, the
          Russian authorities had been cultivating and supporting US Republican
          presidential candidate, Donald TRUMP for at least 5 years. Source B
          asserted that the TRUMP operation was both supported and directed by
          Russian President Vladimir PUTIN. Its aim was to sow discord and
          disunity both within the US itself, but more especially within the
          Transatlantic alliance which was viewed as inimical to Russia's
          interests. Source C, a senior Russian financial official said the
          TRUMP operation should be seen in terms of PUTIN's desire to return to
          Nineteenth Century 'Great Power' politics anchored upon countries'
          interests rather than the ideals-based international order established
          after World War Two, S/he had overheard PUTIN talking in this way to
          close associates on several occasions.
        </li>
        <li>
          In terms of specifics, Source A confided that the Kremlin had been
          feeding TRUMP and his team valuable intelligence on his opponents,
          including Democratic presidential candidate Hillary CLINTON, for
          several years [see more below]. This was confirmed by Source D, a
          close associate of TRUMP who had organized and managed his recent
          trips to Moscow, and who reported, also in June 2016, that this
          Russian intelligence had been "very helpful". The Kremlin's
          cultivation operation on TRUMP also had comprised offering him various
          lucrative real estate development business deals in Russia, especially
          in relation to the ongoing 2018 World Cup soccer tournament. However,
          so far, for reasons unknown, TRUMP had not taken up any of these.
        </li>
        <li>
          However, there were other aspects to TRUMP's engagement with the
          Russian authorities. One which had borne fruit for them was to exploit
          personal obsessions and sexual perversion in order to obtain suitable
          'kompromat' [compromising material] on him. According to Source D,
          where s/he had been present, (perverted) conduct in Moscow included
          hiring the presidential suite of the Ritz Carlton Hotel, where he knew
          President and OBAMA [whom he hated] had stayed on one of their
          official trips to Russia, and defiling the bed where they had slept by
          employing a number of prostitutes to perform a 'golden
          showers'(urination) show in front of him. The hotel was known to be
          under FSB control with microphones and concealed cameras in all the
          main rooms to record anything they wanted to.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Moscow Ritz Carlton episode involving TRUMP reported above was
          confirmed by Source E, [redacted], who said that s/he and several of
          the staff were aware of it at the time and subsequently. S/he believed
          it had happened in 2013. Source E provided an introduction for a
          company ethnic Russian operative to Source F, a female staffer at the
          hotel when TRUMP had stayed there, who also confirmed the story.
          Speaking separately in June 2016, Source [the former top level Russian
          intelligence officer] asserted that TRUMP's unorthodox behavior in
          Russia over the years had provided the authorities there with enough
          embarrassing material on the now Republican presidential candidate to
          be able to blackmail him if they so wished.
        </li>
        <li>
          Asked about the Kremlin's reported intelligence feed to TRUMP over
          recent years and rumours about a Russian dossier of 'kompromat' on
          Hillary CLINTON (being circulated), Source B confirmed the file's
          existence. S/he confided in a trusted compatriot that it had been
          collated by Department K of the FSB for many years, dating back to her
          husband Bill's presidency, and comprised mainly eavesdropped
          conversations of various sorts rather than details/evidence of
          unorthodox or embarrassing behavior. Some of the conversations were
          from bugged comments CLINTON had made on her various trips to Russia
          and focused on things she had said which contradicted her current
          position on various issues. Others were most probably from phone
          intercepts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Continuing on this theme, Source G, a senior Kremlin official,
          confided that the CLINTON dossier was controlled exclusively by chief
          spokesman, Dmitry PESKOV, who was responsible for compiling/handling
          it on the explicit instructions of PUTIN himself. The dossier however
          had not as yet been made available abroad, including to TRUMP or his
          campaign team. At present it was unclear what intentions were in this
          regard.

      <h3>
        RUSSIA/CYBER CRIME: A SYNOPSIS OF RUSSIAN STATE SPONSORED AND OTHER
        CYBER OFFENSIVE (CRIMINAL) OPERATIONS
      </h3>
      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Russia has extensive programme of state-sponsored offensive cyber
          operations. External targets include foreign governments and big
          corporations, especially banks. FSB leads on cyber within Russian
          apparatus. Limited success in attacking top foreign targets like G7
          governments, security services and IFIs but much more on second tier
          ones through IT back doors, using corporate and other visitors to
          Russia
        </li>
        <li>
          FSB often uses coercion and blackmail to recruit most capable cyber
          operatives in Russia into its state-sponsored programmes. Heavy use
          also, both wittingly and unwittingly, of CIS emigres working in
          western corporations and ethnic Russians employed by neighbouring
          governments e.g. Latvia
        </li>
        <li>
          Example cited of successful Russian cyber operation targeting senior
          Western business visitor. Provided back door into important Western
          institutions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Example given of US citizen of Russian origin approached by FSB and
          offered incentive of "investment" in his business when visiting
          Moscow.
        </li>
        <li>
          Problems however for Russian authorities themselves in countering
          local hackers and cyber criminals, operating outside state control.
          Central Bank claims there were over 20 serious attacks on
          correspondent accounts held by CBR in 2015, comprising Roubles several
          billion in fraud
        </li>
        <li>
          Some details given of leading non-state Russian cyber criminal groups
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Details</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Speaking in June 2016, a number of Russian figures with a detailed
          knowledge of national cyber crime, both state-sponsored and otherwise,
          outlined the current situation in this area. A former senior
          intelligence officer divided Russian state-sponsored offensive cyber
          operations into four categories (in order of priority):- targeting
          foreign, especially western governments; penetrating leading foreign
          business corporations, especially banks; domestic monitoring of the
          elite; and attacking political opponents both at home and abroad. The
          former intelligence officer reported that the Federal Security Service
          (FSB) was the lead organization within the Russian state apparatus for
          cyber operations.
        </li>
        <li>
          In terms of the success of Russian offensive cyber operations to date,
          a senior government figure reported that there had been only limited
          success in penetrating the "first tier" foreign targets. These
          comprised western (especially G7 and NATO) governments, security and
          intelligence services and central banks, and the lFls. To compensate
          for this shortfall, massive effort had been invested, with much
          greater success, in attacking the "secondary targets", particularly
          western private banks and the governments of smaller states allied to
          the West. S/he mentioned Latvia in this regard. Hundreds of agents,
          either consciously cooperating with the FSB or whose personal and
          professional IT systems had been unwittingly compromised, were
          recruited. Many were people who had ethnic and family ties to Russia
          and or had been incentivized financially to cooperate. Such people
          often would receive monetary inducements or contractual favours from
          the Russian state or its agents in return. This had created
          difficulties for parts of the Russian state apparatus in
          obliging/indulging them e.g. the Central Bank of Russia knowingly
          having to cover up for such agents' money laundering operations
          through the Russian financial system.
        </li>
        <li>
          In terms of the FSB's recruitment of capable cyber operatives to carry
          out its, ideally deniable, offensive cyber operations, a Russian IT
          specialist with direct knowledge reported in June 2016 that this was
          often done using coercion and blackmail. In terms of 'foreign' agents,
          the FSB was approaching US citizens of Russian (Jewish) origin on
          business trips to Russia. In one case a US citizen of Russian
          ethnicity had been visiting Moscow to attract investors in his new
          information technology program. The FSB clearly knew this and had
          offered to provide seed capital to this person in return for them
          being able to access and modify his IP, with a view to targeting
          priority foreign targets by planting a Trojan virus in the software.
          The US visitor was told this was common practice. The FSB also had
          implied significant operational success as a result of installing
          cheap Russian IT games containing their own malware unwittingly by
          targets on their PCs and other platforms.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a more advanced and successful FSB operation, an IT operator inside
          a leading Russian SOE, who previously had been employed on
          conventional (defensive) IT work there, had been under instruction for
          the last year to conduct an offensive cyber operation against a
          foreign director of the company. Although the latter was apparently an
          infrequent visitor to Russia, the FSB now successfully had penetrated
          his personal IT and through this had managed to access various
          important institutions in the West through the back door.
        </li>
        <li>
          In terms of other technical IT platforms, an FSB cyber operative
          flagged up the 'Telegram' enciphered commercial system as having been
          of especial concern and therefore heavily targeted by the FSB, not
          least because it was used frequently by Russian internal political
          activists and oppositionists. His/her understanding was that the FSB
          now successfully had cracked this communications software and
          therefore it was no longer secure to use.
        </li>
        <li>
          The senior Russian government figure cited above also reported that
          non-state sponsored cyber crime was becoming an increasing problem
          inside Russia for the government and authorities there. The Central
          Bank of Russia claimed that in 2015 alone there had been more than 20
          attempts at serious cyber embezzlement of money from corresponding
          accounts held there, comprising several billions Roubles. More
          generally, s/he understood there were circa 15 major organised crime
          groups in the country involved in cyber crime, all of which continued
          to operate largely outside state and FSB control. These included the
          so-called 'Anunak', 'Buktrap' and 'Metel' organisations.

        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Detail</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Speaking in confidence to a compatriot in late July 2016, Source E, an
          ethnic Russian close associate of Republican US presidential candidate
          Donald TRUMP, admitted that there was a well-developed conspiracy of
          co-operation between them and the Russian leadership. This was managed
          on the TRUMP side by the Republican candidate's campaign manager, Paul
          MANAFORT, who was using foreign policy advisor, Carter PAGE, and
          others as intermediaries. The two sides had a mutual interest in
          defeating Democratic presidential candidate Hillary CLINTON, whom
          President PUTIN apparently both hated and feared.
        </li>
        <li>
          Inter alia, Source E, acknowledged that the Russian regime had been
          behind the recent leak of embarrassing e-mail messages, emanating from
          the Democratic National Committee (DNC), to the WikiLeaks platform.
        </li>
        <li>
          The reason for using WikiLeaks was "plausible deniability" and the
          operation had been conducted with the full knowledge and support of
          TRUMP and senior members of his campaign team. In return the TRUMP
          team had agreed to sideline Russian intervention in Ukraine as a
          campaign issue and to raise defence commitments in the Baltics and
          Eastern Europe to deflect attention away from Ukraine, a priority for
          PUTIN who needed to cauterise the subject.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the wider context campaign/Kremlin co-operation, Source E claimed
          that the intelligence network being used against CLINTON comprised
          three elements. Firstly, there were agents/facilitators within the
          Democratic Party structure itself; secondly Russian emigre' and
          associated offensive cyber operators based in the US; and thirdly,
          state-sponsored cyber operatives working in Russia. All three elements
          had played an important role to date. On the mechanism for rewarding
          relevant assets based in the US, and effecting a two-way flow of
          intelligence and other useful information, Source E claimed that
          Russian diplomatic staff in key cities such as New York, Washington DC
          and Miami were using the emigre' "pension" distribution system as
          cover. The operation therefore depended on key people in the US
          Russian emigre' community for its success. Tens of thousands of
          dollars were involved.
        </li>
        <li>
          In terms of the intelligence flow from the TRUMP team to Russia,
          Source E reported that much of this concerned the activities of
          business oligarchs and their families' activities and assets in the
          US, with which PUTIN and the Kremlin seemed preoccupied.
        </li>
        <li>
          Commenting on the negative media publicity surrounding alleged Russian
          interference in the US election campaign in support of TRUMP, Source E
          said he understood that the Republican candidate and his team were
          relatively relaxed about this because it deflected media and the
          Democrats' attention away from TRUMP's business dealings in China and
          other emerging markets. Unlike in Russia, these were substantial and
          involved the payment of large bribes and kickbacks which, were they to
          become public, would be potentially very damaging to their campaign.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, regarding TRUMP's claimed minimal investment profile in
          Russia, a separate source with direct knowledge said this had not been
          for want of trying. TRUMP's previous efforts had included exploring
          the real estate sector in St Petersburg as well as Moscow but in the
          end TRUMP had had to settle for the use of extensive sexual services
          there from local prostitutes rather than business success.

        RUSSIA-US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: KREMLIN CONCERN THAT POLITICAL FALLOUT
        FROM DNC E-MAIL HACKING AFFAIR SPIRALLING OUT OF CONTROL
      </h3>
      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Kremlin concerned that political fallout from DNC e-mail hacking
          operation is spiraling out of control. Extreme nervousness among
          associates as result of negative media attention/accusations
        </li>
        <li>
          Russians meanwhile keen to cool situation and maintain 'plausible
          deniability' of existing /ongoing and operations. Therefore unlikely
          to be any ratcheting up offensive plays in immediate future
        </li>
        <li>
          Source close to TRUMP campaign however confirms regular exchange with
          Kremlin has existed for at least 8 years, including intelligence fed
          back to Russia on oligarchs' activities in US
        </li>
        <li>
          Russians apparently have promised not to use 'kompromat' they hold on
          TRUMP as leverage, given high levels of voluntary co-operation
          forthcoming from his team
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Detail</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Speaking in confidence to a trusted associate in late July 2016, a
          Russian emigre' figure close to the Republican US presidential
          candidate Donald TRUMP's campaign team commented on the fallout from
          publicity surrounding the Democratic National Committee (DNC) e-mail
          hacking scandal. The emigre' said there was a high level of anxiety
          within the TRUMP team as a result of various accusations levelled
          against them and indications from the Kremlin that President PUTIN and
          others in the leadership thought things had gone too far now and
          risked spiralling out of control.
        </li>
        <li>
          Continuing on this theme, the emigre' associate of TRUMP opined that
          the Kremlin wanted the situation to calm but for 'plausible
          deniability' to be maintained concerning its (extensive) pro-TRUMP and
          anti-CLINTON operations. S/he therefore judged that it was unlikely
          these would be ratcheted up, at least for the time being.
        </li>
        <li>
          However, in terms of established operational liaison between the TRUMP
          team and the Kremlin, the emigre' confirmed that an intelligence
          exchange had been running between them for at least 8 years. Within
          this context PUTIN's priority requirement had been for intelligence on
          the activities, business and otherwise, in the US of leading Russian
          oligarchs and their families. TRUMP and his associates duly had
          obtained and supplied the Kremlin with this information.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, the emigre' said s/he understood the Kremlin had more
          intelligence on CLINTON and her campaign but he did not know the
          details or when or if it would be released. As far as 'kompromat'
          (compromising information) on TRUMP were concerned, although there was
          plenty of this, he understood the Kremlin had given its word that it
          would not be deployed against the Republican presidential candidate
          given how helpful and co-operative his team had been over several
          years, and particularly of late.

          altogether, but this still largely wishful thinking by more liberal

        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Detail</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Speaking in early August 2016, two well-placed and established Kremlin
          sources outlined the divisions and backlash in Moscow arising from the
          leaking of Democratic National Committee (DNC) e-mails and the wider
          pro-TRUMP operation being conducted in the US. Head of Presidential
          Administration, Sergei IVANOV, was angry at the recent turn of events.
          He believed the Kremlin "team" involved, led by presidential spokesman
          Dmitriy PESKOV, had gone too far in interfering in foreign affairs
          with their "elephant in a china shop black PR". IVANOV claimed always
          to have opposed the handling and exploitation of intelligence by this
          PR "team". Following the backlash against such foreign interference in
          US politics, IVANOV was advocating that the only sensible course of
          action now for the Russian leadership was to "sit tight and deny
          everything".
        </li>
        <li>
          Continuing on this theme the source close to IVANOV reported that
          PESKOV now was "scared shitless" that he would be scapegoated by PUTIN
          and the Kremlin and held responsible for the backlash against Russian
          political interference in the US election. IVANOV was determined to
          stop PESKOV playing an independent role in relation to the US going
          forward and the source fully expected the presidential spokesman now
          to lay low. PESKOV's position was not helped by a botched attempt by
          him also to interfere in the recent failed coup in Turkey from a
          government relations (GR) perspective (no further details).
        </li>
        <li>
          The extent of disquiet and division within Moscow caused by the
          backlash against Russian interference in the US election was
          underlined by a second source, close to premier Dmitriy MEDVEDEV
          (DAM). S/he said the Russian prime minister and his colleagues wanted
          to have good relations with the US, regardless of who was in power
          there, and not least so as to be able to travel there in future,
          either officially or privately. They were openly refusing to cover up
          for PESKOV and others involved in the operations or to support his
          counter-attack of allegations against the USG for its alleged hacking
          of the Russian government and state agencies.
        </li>
        <li>
          According to the first source, close to IVANOV, there had been talk in
          the Kremlin of TRUMP being forced to withdraw from the presidential
          race altogether as a result of recent events, ostensibly on grounds of
          his state and unsuitability for high office. This might not be so bad
          for Russia in the circumstances but in the view of the source, it
          remained largely wishful thinking on the part of those in the regime
          opposed to PESKOV and his "botched" operations, at least for the time
          being.

      </ul>
      <h3>Details</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Speaking in confidence to a close colleague in early August 2016, head
          of the Russian Presidential Administration (PA), Sergei IVANOV,
          assessed the impact and results of Kremlin intervention in the US
          presidential election to date. Although most commentators believed
          that the Kremlin was behind the leaked DNC/CLINTON e-mails, this
          remained technically deniable. Therefore the Russians would not risk
          their position for the time being with new leaked material, even to a
          third party like WikiLeaks. Rather the tactics would be to spread
          rumours and misinformation about the content of what already had been
          leaked and make up new content.
        </li>
        <li>
          Continuing on this theme, IVANOV said that the audience to be targeted
          by such operations was the educated youth in America as the PA
          assessed that there was still a chance they could be persuaded to vote
          for Republican candidate Donald TRUMP as a protest against the
          Washington establishment (in the form of Democratic candidate Hillary
          CLINTON). The hope was that even if she won, as a result of this
          CLINTON in power would be bogged down in working for internal
          reconciliation in the US, rather than being able to focus on foreign
          policy which would damage Russia's interests. This also should give
          President PUTIN more room for manoeuvre in the run-up to Russia's own
          presidential election in 2018.
        </li>
        <li>
          IVANOV reported that although the Kremlin had underestimated the
          strength of US media and liberal reaction to the DNC hack and TRUMP's
          links to Russia, PUTIN was generally satisfied with the progress of
          the anti-CLINTON operation to date. He recently had had a drink with
          PUTIN to mark this. In IVANOV's view, the US had tried to divide the
          Russian elite with sanctions but failed, whilst they, by contrast, had
          succeeded in splitting the US hawks inimical to Russia and the
          Washington elite more generally, half of whom had refused to endorse
          any presidential candidates a result of Russian intervention.
        </li>
        <li>
          Speaking separately, also in early August 2016, a Kremlin official
          involved in US relations commented on aspects of the Russian operation
          to date. Its goals had been threefold- asking sympathetic US actors
          how Moscow could help them; gathering relevant intelligence; and
          creating and disseminating compromising information ('kompromat').
          This had involved the Kremlin supporting various US political figures,
          including funding indirectly their recent visits to Moscow. S/he named
          a delegation from Lyndon LAROUCHE; presidential candidate Jill STEIN
          of the Green Party; TRUMP foreign policy adviser Carter PAGE; and
          former DIA Director Michael Flynn, in this regard and as successful in
          terms of perceived outcomes.

      <h3>Detail</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Speaking in confidence on 9 August 2016, an ethnic Russian associate
          of Republican US presidential candidate Donald TRUMP discussed the
          reaction inside his camp, and revised tactics therein resulting from
          recent negative publicity concerning Moscow's clandestine involvement
          in the campaign. TRUMP's associate reported that the aim of leaking
          the DNC e-mails to WikiLeaks during the Democratic Convention had been
          to swing supporters of Bernie SANDERS away from Hillary CLINTON and
          across to TRUMP. These voters were perceived as activist and
          anti-status quo and anti-establishment and in that regard sharing many
          features with the TRUMP campaign, including a visceral dislike of
          Hillary CLINTON. This objective had been conceived and promoted, inter
          alia, by TRUMP's foreign policy adviser Carter PAGE who had discussed
          it directly with the ethnic Russian associate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Continuing on this theme, the ethnic Russian associate of TRUMP
          assessed that the problem was that the TRUMP campaign had
          underestimated the strength of the negative reaction from liberals and
          especially the conservative elite to Russian interference. This was
          forcing a rethink and a likely change of tactics. The main objective
          in the short term was to check Democratic candidate Hillary CLINTON's
          successful exploitation of the PUTIN as bogeyman/Russian interference
          story to tarnish TRUMP and bolster her own (patriotic) credentials.
          The TRUMP campaign was focusing on tapping into support in the
          American television media to achieve this, as they reckoned this
          resource had been underused by them to date.
        </li>
        <li>
          However, associate also admitted that there was a fair amount of anger
          and resentment within the Republican candidate's team at what was
          perceived by PUTIN as going beyond the objective of weakening CLINTON
          and bolstering TRUMP, by attempting to exploit the situation to
          undermine the US government and democratic system more generally. It
          was unclear at present how this aspect of the situation would play out
          in the weeks to come.

          importance of the Russian parastatal organisation, Rossotrudnichestvo,
          in this contact between TRUMP campaign representative/s and Kremlin
          officials. Rossotrudnichestvo was being used as cover for this
          relationship and its office in Prague may well have been used to host
          the COHEN/Russian Presidential Administration (PA) meeting/s. It was
          considered a "plausibly deniable" vehicle for this, whilst remaining
          entirely under Kremlin control.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Kremlin insider went on to identify leading pro-PUTIN Duma figure,
          Konstantin KOSACHEV (Head of the Foreign Relations Committee) as an
          important figure in the TRUMP campaign-Kremlin liaison operation.
          KOSACHEV, also "plausibly deniable" being part of the Russian
          legislature rather than executive, had facilitated the contact in
          Prague and by implication, may have attended the meeting/s with COHEN
          there in August.

          We reported previously, in our Company Intelligence Report 2016/135 of
          19 October 2016 from the same source, that COHEN met officials from
          the PA Legal Department clandestinely in an EU country in August 2016.
          This was in order to clean up the mess left behind by western media
          revelations of TRUMP ex-campaign manager MANAFORT's corrupt
          relationship with the former pro-Russian YANUKOVYCH regime in Ukraine
          and TRUMP foreign policy advisor, Carter PAGE's secret meetings in
          Moscow with senior regime figures in July 2016. According to the
          Kremlin advisor, these meeting/s were originally scheduled for COHEN
          in Moscow but shifted to what was considered an operationally "soft"
          EU country when it was judged too compromising for him to travel to
          the Russian capital.

      <h3>COMPANY INTELLIGENCE REPORT 2016/105</h3>
      <h3>THE DEMISE OF CAMPAIGN MANAGER PAUL MANAFORT</h3>
      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Ex-Ukrainian President YANUKOVYCH confides directly to PUTIN that he
          authorised kick-back payments to MANAFORT, as alleged in western
          media. Assures Russian President however there is no documentary
          evidence/trail
        </li>
        <li>
          PUTIN and Russian leadership remain worried however and sceptical that
          YANUKOVYCH has fully covered the traces of these payments to TRUMP's
          former campaign manager
        </li>
        <li>
          Close associate of TRUMP explains reasoning behind MANAFORT's recent
          resignation. Ukraine revelations played part but others wanted
          MANAFORT out for various reasons, especially LEWANDOWSKI who remains
          influential
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Detail</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Speaking in late August 2016, in the immediate aftermath of Paul
          MANAFORT's resignation as campaign manager for US Republican
          presidential candidate Donald TRUMP, a well-placed Russian figure
          reported on a recent meeting between President PUTIN and ex-President
          YANUKOVYCH of Ukraine. This had been held in secret on 15 August near
          Volgograd, Russia and the western media revelations about MANAFORT and
          Ukraine had featured prominently on the agenda. YANUKOVYCH had
          confided in PUTIN that he did authorise and order substantial
          kick-back payments to MANAFORT as alleged but sought to reassure him
          that there was no documentary trail left behind which could provide
          clear evidence of this.
        </li>
        <li>
          Given YANUKOVYCH's (unimpressive) record in covering up his own
          corrupt tracks in the past, PUTIN and others in the Russian leadership
          were sceptical about the ex-Ukrainian president's reassurances on this
          as relating to MANAFORT. They therefore still feared the scandal had
          legs, especially as MANAFORT had been commercially active in Ukraine
          right up to the time (in March 2016) when he joined campaign team. For
          them it therefore remained a point of potential political
          vulnerability and embarrassment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Speaking separately, also in late August 2016, an American political
          figure associated with Donald TRUMP and his campaign outlined the
          reasons behind MANAFORT's recent demise. S/he said it was true that
          the Ukraine corruption revelations had played a part in this but also,
          several senior players close to TRUMP had wanted MANAFORT out,
          primarily to loosen his control on strategy and policy formulation. Of
          particular importance in this regard was MANAFORT's predecessor as
          campaign manager, Corey LEWANDOWSKI, who hated MANAFORT personally and
          remained close to TRUMP with whom he discussed the presidential
          campaign on a regular basis.

      </ul>
      <h3>Detail</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Speaking in confidence to a trusted compatriot in mid-September 2016,
          a senior member of the Russian Presidential Administration
          (PA)commented on the political fallout from recent western media
          revelations about Moscow's intervention, in favour of Donald TRUMP and
          against Hillary CLINTON, in the US presidential election. The PA
          official reported that the issue had become incredibly sensitive and
          that President PUTIN had issued direct orders that Kremlin and
          government insiders should not discuss it in public or even in
          private.
        </li>
        <li>
          Despite this, the PA official confirmed, from direct knowledge, that
          the gist of the allegations was true. PUTIN had been receiving
          conflicting advice on interfering from three separate and expert
          groups. On one side had been the Russian ambassador to the US, Sergei
          KISLYAK and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, together with an
          independent and informal network run by presidential foreign policy
          advisor, Yuri USHAKOV (KISLYAK's predecessor in Washington) who had
          urged caution and the potential negative impact on Russia from the
          operation/s. On the other side was former PA Head, Sergei IVANOV,
          backed by Russian Foreign Intelligence (SVR), who had advised PUTIN
          that the anti-CLINTON operation/s would be both effective and
          plausibly deniable with little blowback. The first group/s had been
          proven right and this had been the catalyst in PUTIN's decision to
          sack IVANOV (unexpectedly) as PA Head in August. His successor, Anton
          VAINO, had been selected for the job partly because he had not been
          involved in the US presidential election operation/s.
        </li>
        <li>
          Continuing on this theme, the senior PA official said the situation
          now was that the Kremlin had further 'kompromat' on candidate CLINTON
          and had been considering releasing this via "plausibly deniable"
          channels after the Duma (legislative) elections were out of the way in
          mid-September. There was however a growing train of thought and
          associated lobby, arguing that the Russians could still make candidate
          CLINTON look "weak and stupid" by provoking her into railing against
          PUTIN and Russia without the need to release more of her e-mails.
          Presidential Spokesman, Dmitriy PESKOV remained a key figure in the
          operation, although any final decision on dissemination of further
          material would be taken by PUTIN himself.
        </li>
        <li>
          The senior PA official also reported that a growing element in
          Moscow's intervention in the US presidential election campaign was the
          objective of shifting the US political consensus in Russia's perceived
          interests regardless of who won. It basically comprised of pushing
          candidate CLINTON away from President policies. The best example of
          this was that both candidates now openly opposed the draft trade
          agreements, TPP and TTIP, which were assessed by Moscow as detrimental
          to Russian interests. Other issues where the Kremlin was looking to
          shift the US policy consensus were Ukraine and Syria. Overall however,
          the presidential election was considered still to be too close to
          call.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, speaking separately to the same compatriot, a senior Russian
          MFA official reported that as a prophylactic measure, a leading
          Russian diplomat, Mikhail KULAGIN, had been withdrawn from Washington
          at short notice because Moscow feared his heavy involvement-in the US
          presidential election operation, including the so-called veterans'
          pensions ruse (reported previously), would be exposed in the media
          there. His replacement, Andrei BONDAREV however was clean in this
          regard.

        <li>
          PUTIN personally unbothered about Alpha's current lack of investment

        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Detail</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Speaking to a trusted compatriot in mid-September 2016, a top level
          Russian government official commented on the history and current state
          of relations between President PUTIN and the Alpha Group of businesses
          led by oligarchs Mikhail FRIDMAN, Petr AVEN and German KHAN. The
          Russian government figure reported that although they had had their
          ups and downs, the leading figures in Alpha currently were on very
          good terms with PUTIN. Significant favours continued to be done in
          both directions, primarily political ones for PUTIN and business/legal
          ones for Alpha. Also, FRIDMAN and AVEN continued to give informal
          advice to PUTIN on foreign policy, and especially about the US where
          he distrusted advice being given to him by officials.
        </li>
        <li>
          Although FRIDMAN recently had met directly with PUTIN in Russia, much
          of the dialogue and business between them was mediated through a
          senior Presidential Administration Official, Oleg GOVORUN, who
          currently headed the department therein responsible for Social
          Co-operation with the CIS. GOVORUN was trusted by PUTIN and recently
          had accompanied him to Uzbekistan to pay respects at the tomb of
          former president KARIMOV. However according to the top level Russian
          government official, during the 1990s GOVORUN had been Head Of
          Government Relations at Alpha Group and in reality, the "driver" and
          "bag carrier" used by FRIDMAN and AVEN to deliver large amounts of
          illicit cash to the Russian president, at that time deputy Mayor of St
          Petersburg. Given that and the continuing sensitivity of the
          relationship, and need for plausible deniability, much of the contact
          between them was now indirect and entrusted to the relatively low
          profile GOVORUN.
        </li>
        <li>
          The top level Russian government official described the PUTlN-Alpha
          relationship as both carrot and stick. Alpha held 'kompromat' on PUTIN
          and his corrupt business activities from the 1990s whilst although not
          personally overly bothered by Alpha's failure to reinvest the proceeds
          of its TNK oil company sale into the Russian economy Since, the
          president was able to use pressure on this count from senior Kremlin
          colleagues as a lever on FRIDMAN and AVEN to make them do his
          political bidding.

        <li>
          Speaking to a trusted compatriot in September 2016, two well-placed
          sources based in St Petersburg, one in the political/business elite
          and the other involved in the local services and tourist industry,
          commented on Republican US presidential candidate Donald prior
          activities in the city.
        </li>
        <li>
          Both knew TRUMP had visited St Petersburg on several occasions in the
          past and had been interested in doing business deals there involving
          real estate. The local business/ political elite figure reported that
          TRUMP had paid bribes there to further his interests but very
          discreetly and only through affiliated companies, making it very hard
          to prove. The local services industry source reported that TRUMP had
          participated in sex parties in the city too, but that all direct
          witnesses to this recently had been "silenced" i.e. bribed or coerced
          to disappear.

          The two St Petersburg figures cited believed an Azeri business figure,
          Araz AGALAROV (with offices in Baku and London) had been closely

          Foreign Ministry to FSB and then to presidential administration where
          it now sits
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Detail</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Speaking separately in confidence to a trusted compatriot in early
          October 2016, a senior Russian leadership figure and a Foreign
          Ministry official reported on recent developments concerning the
          Kremlin's operation to support Republican candidate Donald TRUMP in
          the US presidential election. The senior leadership figure said that a
          degree of buyer's remorse was setting in among Russian leaders
          concerning TRUMP. PUTIN and his colleagues were surprised and
          disappointed that leaks ot Democratic candidate. Hillary CLINTON's
          hacked e-mails had not had greater impact on the campaign.
        </li>
        <li>
          Continuing on this theme, the senior leadership figure commented that
          a stream of further hacked CLINTON material already had been injected
          by the Kremlin into compliant western media outlets like WlkiLeaks,
          which remained at least "plausibly deniable", so the stream of these
          would continue through October and up to the election. However s/he
          understood that the best material the Russians had already was out and
          there were no real game-changers to come.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Russian Foreign Ministry official, who had direct access to the
          TRUMP support operation, reported that PUTIN was angry at his
          suboordinate's "over-promising" on the Republican presidential
          candidate, both in terms of his chances and reliability and being able
          to cover and/or contain the US backlash over Kremlin interference.
          More heads therefore were likely to roll, with the MFA the easiest
          target. Ironically, despite his consistent urging of caution on the
          Issue, Foreign Minister LAVROV could be the next one to go.
        </li>
        <li>
          Asked to explain why PUTIN and the Kremlin had launched such an
          aggressive TRUMP support operation in the first place, the MFA
          official said that Russia needed to meet the liberal international
          status quo, including on Ukraine-related sanctions, which was
          seriously disadvantaging the country. TRUMP was viewed as divisive in
          disrupting the whole US political system; anti-Establishment; and a
          pragmatist with whom they could do business. As the TRUMP support
          operation had gained momentum, control of it had passed from the MFA
          to the FSB and then into the presidential administration whore it
          remained, a reflection of its growing significance over time. There
          was still a view in the Kremlin that TRUMP would continue as a
          {divisive} political force even if he lost the presidency and may run
          for and be elected to another public office.

          Kremlin insider highlights importance of TRUMP's lawyer, Michael COHEN
          in covert relationship with Russia. COHEN's wife is of Russian descent

          Speaking to a trusted compatriot in mid October 2015, a close
          associate of Rosneft President and PUTIN ally Igor SECHIN elaborated
          on the reported secret meeting between the latter and Carter PAGE, of
          US Republican presidential candidate's foreign policy team, in Moscow
          in July 2016. The secret meeting had been confirmed to him/her by a
          senior member of SECHIN's staff, in addition to by the Rosneft
          President himself. It took place on either 7 or 8 July, the same day
          or the one after Carter PAGE made a public speech to the Higher
          Economic School in Moscow.
        </li>
        <li>
          In terms of the substance of their discussion, SECHIN's associate said
          that the Rosneft President was so keen to lift personal and corporate
          western sanctions imposed on the company, that he offered PAGE
          associates the brokerage of up to a 19 per cent (privatised) stake in
          Rosnett in return. PAGE had expressed interest and confirmed that were
          TRUMP elected US president, then sanctions on Russia would be lifted.
        </li>
        <li>
          According to SECHIN's close associate, the Rosnett President had
          continued to believe that TRUMP could win the us presidency right up
          to I7 October, when he assessed this was no longer possible. SECHIN
          was keen to re-adapt accordingly and put feelers out to other business
          and political contacts in the US instead.
        </li>
        <li>
          Speaking separately to the same compatriot in mid-October 2016, a
          Kremlin insider with direct access to the leadership confirmed that a
          key role in the secret TRUMP campaign/Kremlin relationship was being
          played by the Republican candidate's personal lawyer Michael COHEN.
          [Redacted]
        </li>
        <li>
          SECHIN's associate opined that although PAGE had not stated it
          explicitly to SECHIN, he had clearly implied that in terms of his
          comment on TRUMP's intention to lift Russian sanctions if elected
          president, he was speaking with the Republican candidate's authority.

        RUSSIA/US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF TRUMP LAWYER,
        COHEN IN SECRET LIAISON WITH THE KREMLIN
      </h3>
      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Kremlin insider outlines important role played by TRUMP's lawyer COHEN
          in secret liaison with Russian leadership
        </li>
        <li>
          COHEN engaged with Russians in trying to cover up scandal of MANAFORT
          and exposure of PAGE and meets Kremlin officials secretly in the EU in
          August in pursuit of this goal
        </li>
        <li>
          These secret contacts continue but are now farmed out to trusted
          agents in Kremlin-linked institutes so as to remain "plausibly
          deniable" for Russian regime
        </li>
        <li>
          Further confirmation that sacking of IVANOV and appointments of VAINO
          and KIRIYENKO linked to need to cover up Kremlin's TRUMP support
          operation
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Detail</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Speaking in confidence to a longstanding compatriot friend in
          mid-October 2016, a Kremlin insider highlighted the importance of
          Republican presidential candidate Donald TRUMP's lawyer, Michael
          COHEN, in the ongoing secret liaison relationship between the New York
          tycoon's campaign and the Russian leadership. COHEN's role had grown
          following the departure of Paul MANNAFORT as campaign manager in
          August 2016. Prior to that MANNAFORT had led for the TRUMP side.
        </li>
        <li>
          According to the Kremlin insider, COHEN now was heavily engaged in a
          cover up and damage limitation operation in the attempt to prevent the
          full details of relationship with Russia being exposed. In pursuit of
          this aim, COHEN had met secretly with several Russian Presidential
          Administration (PA) Legal Department officials in an EU country in
          August 2016. The immediate issues had been to contain further scandals
          involving MANNAFORT's commercial and political role in Russia/Ukraine
          and to limit the damage arising from exposure of former TRUMP foreign
          policy advisor, Carter PAGE's secret meetings with Russian leadership
          figures in Moscow the previous month. The overall objective had been
          to "to sweep it all under the carpet and make sure no connections
          could be fully established or proven"
        </li>
        <li>
          Things had become even "hotter" since August on the track. According
          to the Kremlin insider, this had meant that direct contact between the
          TRUMP team and Russia had been farmed out by the Kremlin to trusted
          agents of influence working in pro-government policy institutes like
          that of Law and Comparative Jurisprudence. COHEN however continued to
          lead for the TRUMP team.
        </li>
        <li>
          Referring back to the (surprise) sacking of Sergei IVANOV as Head of
          PA in August 2016, his replacement by Anton VAINO and the appointment
          of former Russian premier Sergei KIRIYENKO to another senior position
          in the PA, the Kremlin insider repeated that this had been directly
          connected to the TRUMP support operation and the need to cover up now
          that it was being exposed by the USG and in the western media.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Company Comment</p>
        <p>
          The Kremlin insider was unsure of the identities of the PA officials
          with whom COHEN met secretly in August, or the exact date/s and
          locations of the meeting/s. There were significant internal security
          barriers being erected in the PA as the TRUMP issue became more
          controversial and damaging. However s/he continued to try to obtain
          these.

          Prague, Czech Republic in August 2016 between then Republican
          presidential candidate Donald TRUMP's representative, Michael COHEN
          and his interlocutors from the Kremlin working under cover of Russian

          [Redacted] provided further details of these meeting/s and associated
          anti-CLINTON /Democratic Party operations. COHEN had been accompanied
          to Prague by 3 colleagues and the timing of the visit was either in

          comprised questions on how deniable cash payments were to be made to
          hackers who had worked in Europe under Kremlin direction against the
          CLINTON campaign and various contingencies for covering up these
          operations and Moscow's secret liaison with the TRUMP team more
          generally.
